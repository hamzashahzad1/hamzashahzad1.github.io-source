I am an incoming PhD Computer Science and Engineering student at UC Santa Cruz. I will be starting my PhD from September 2022, where I will be working under the supervision of Professor <a href = "http://idemertzis.com/" target="_blank">Ioannis Demertzis</a>. Recently, I completed my bachelor's in Computer Science from Lahore University of Management Sciences, where I studied several advanced courses in systems and networks. I am generally interested in exploring all aspects of systems, and am always curious to learn new topics within the field.
